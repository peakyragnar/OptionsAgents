# SPX Options Dealer Gamma Tracker - System Fixes

## WebSocket Connection Issues

Fixed the `ClientConnectionResetError` in `trade_feed.py` by:

1. **Improved Authentication:**
   - Added explicit authentication step with API key
   - Properly formatted subscription messages with "OT." prefix

2. **Optimized Connection Handling:**
   - Reduced subscription batch size from 100 to 50 symbols
   - Added small delay between subscription batches to prevent overloading
   - Increased timeout settings for better stability

3. **Better Error Handling:**
   - Implemented exponential backoff for reconnection attempts
   - Added more detailed logging for connection status
   - Properly handled different WebSocket message types

## Trade Processing Issues

Fixed the gamma calculation issues in `engine.py` by:

1. **Polygon Format Support:**
   - Added support for Polygon.io's WebSocket message format
   - Properly extracted trade fields from Polygon messages

2. **Type Safety:**
   - Added proper type conversion for numeric fields (price, size)
   - Added validation for input parameters

3. **Error Handling:**
   - Added comprehensive try/except blocks to prevent processing crashes
   - Added detailed logging of trade processing steps
   - Handled edge cases like expired options

## Volatility Surface Issues

Fixed the `TypeError: must be real number, not NoneType` errors in `surface.py` by:

1. **Improved Cache Logic:**
   - Better handling of cache misses and stale values
   - Proper handling of None references in calculations

2. **Robust Volatility Estimation:**
   - Added fallback to moneyness-based estimation when implied vol calculation fails
   - Protected against invalid inputs (negative prices, zero values)
   - Added reasonable default volatility values

3. **Error Handling:**
   - Added exception handling for volatility calculation failures
   - Added capability to retain previous volatility estimates when new calculations fail

## Database Issues

Fixed the DuckDB connection issues in `persistence.py` by:

1. **Lazy Connection:**
   - Implemented connection-on-demand instead of always-on connection
   - Added proper connection cleanup with atexit handler

2. **Thread Safety:**
   - Used locking to prevent concurrent access issues
   - Protected database operations from concurrent modification

3. **Database Utilities:**
   - Added functions to query gamma history
   - Improved timestamp handling and datetime conversion

## Testing Infrastructure

Added testing and diagnostic tools:

1. **Mock Data:**
   - Created sample trade generator for replay testing
   - Added mock quote data for offline testing

2. **Diagnostic Tools:**
   - Added comprehensive diagnostic utility
   - Added ability to check gamma values and database state

3. **CLI Improvements:**
   - Enhanced replay mode with better feedback
   - Added better error handling in CLI commands

## Performance and Resilience

General system improvements:

1. **Improved Logging:**
   - Added detailed logging throughout the system
   - Made error messages more informative

2. **Defensive Programming:**
   - Added input validation in critical functions
   - Added fallback mechanisms for error conditions
   - Used reasonable defaults when exact calculations fail
